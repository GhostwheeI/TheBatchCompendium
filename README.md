## 🚀 Mission

Batch scripting remains essential for:

- 💻 Offline-safe and dependency-free automation
- ⚙️ Quick tooling in Windows-native environments
- 🔎 Transparent and editable workflows
- 🧪 Scriptable tweaks and system inspection

This repo unifies **hundreds of one-off scripts**, plus **entire toolkits from respected GitHub repos**, into a single location — for the first time.

## 🧪 Sample Tools

Here’s a peek at the kind of tools inside:

- `Cleanup & Maintenance/ClearTemp.bat` – Empty all temp folders safely
- `Privacy & Debloating/Win10Debloat.bat` – Strip bloat and silence telemetry
- `System Optimization & Tweaks/EnableTrim.bat` – Enable SSD TRIM on demand
- `Hardware & Network Tweaks/FixEthernet.bat` – Repair adapter states
- `File & Media Utilities/MassRename.bat` – Batch-rename files by pattern
- `Security & Diagnostics/LogDump.bat` – Dump recent event logs for analysis

---

## ⚙️ How to Use

> ⚠️ Most scripts require **elevated (admin) Command Prompt**  
> 💡 Always review scripts before running

### Example:

```bat
cd "Cleanup & Maintenance"
ClearTemp.bat
```

Most tools run as-is and output their steps directly in the terminal. No installs, no fluff.
