## Caution

üõë **IMPORTANT SAFETY WARNINGS:**

### Before Running Any Script:
- **Create a system backup** or restore point before running system-modifying scripts
- **Review the script code** to understand what changes will be made
- **Test on a non-production system** first when possible
- **Ensure you have administrative privileges** as most scripts require elevated access

### Potential Risks:
- Scripts may modify system registry, services, or critical system files
- Some operations may be irreversible without proper backups
- Improper usage may affect system stability or security
- Scripts from external repositories may have varying levels of testing and support

### Best Practices:
- Always run scripts in a controlled environment first
- Keep regular system backups
- Monitor script output for errors or warnings
- Have a recovery plan in case of unexpected issues

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK** - The authors are not responsible for any damage caused by the use of these scripts.
