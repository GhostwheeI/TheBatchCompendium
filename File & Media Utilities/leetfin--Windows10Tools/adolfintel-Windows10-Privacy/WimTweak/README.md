# WIM TWEAK

From https://github.com/adolfintel/Windows10-Privacy

This is required for some scripts I ported from that repository.

"You will need Install_Wim_Tweak. Download this archive, extract it to your Desktop, then move it to C:\Windows\System32
This is a very handy tool that allows us to remove Windows components with a single command. You can delete it from System32 when you're finished with this guide." - adolfintel
