## Usage

⚠️ **Important**: Most scripts in this directory require **elevated (Administrator) privileges** to run properly.

### General Usage Steps:
1. **Review the script** - Always examine the script content before execution
2. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator** - Right-click Command Prompt and select 'Run as administrator'
3. **Navigate to the script location**:
   ```cmd
   cd "path\to\TheBatchCompendium\[Directory Name]"
   ```
4. **Execute the script**:
   ```cmd
   script_name.bat
   ```

### For Imported Repositories:
- Each imported repository may have its own README.md file with specific instructions
- Check for documentation files (README.md, .txt files) within each repository folder
- Some repositories may require additional dependencies or specific setup steps

## Caution

🛑 **IMPORTANT SAFETY WARNINGS:**

### Before Running Any Script:
- **Create a system backup** or restore point before running system-modifying scripts
- **Review the script code** to understand what changes will be made
- **Test on a non-production system** first when possible
- **Ensure you have administrative privileges** as most scripts require elevated access

### Potential Risks:
- Scripts may modify system registry, services, or critical system files
- Some operations may be irreversible without proper backups
- Improper usage may affect system stability or security
- Scripts from external repositories may have varying levels of testing and support

### Best Practices:
- Always run scripts in a controlled environment first
- Keep regular system backups
- Monitor script output for errors or warnings
- Have a recovery plan in case of unexpected issues

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK** - The authors are not responsible for any damage caused by the use of these scripts.
